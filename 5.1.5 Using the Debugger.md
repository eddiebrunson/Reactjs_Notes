5. Using the Debugger 
___

### How to Debug
As we've mentioned before, perhaps one of the best things about React Native is that it takes the development experience you're used to on the web, and brings it all to native development. Things like live reloading and debugging just work out of the box. Let's take a deeper dive into some of these features -- first with debugging!

### Summary
What's great about React Native development is that it takes much of what you're used to from web development and takes it to native development. Accessing the in-app developer menu allows you to reload your JavaScript code, debug remotely via Developer Tools, and even display an in-app inspector.

### To Debug
All you have to do is shake your phone, or press:

* ⌘D in the iOS simulator
* ⌘M in the Android simulator

### To Refresh
To refresh the app, just:

* Double-tap “R” on your keyboard (if using the simulator)
* Shake the phone, then select “Refresh”
