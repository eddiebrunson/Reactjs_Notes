### React Native under the Hood
When React was first introduced, a big selling point was the [Virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html). The idea is pretty standard in most UI libraries now, but when it first came out, it was groundbreaking! We can look at what exactly the Virtual DOM is by breaking down the process of what happens when you call `setState()`.

The first thing React does when `setState()` is called is merge the object passed to `setState()` into the current state of the component. This will kick off a process called reconciliation. The end goal of [reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html) is to update the UI based on this new state in the most efficient way possible. To do this, React will construct a new tree of React elements (which you can think of as an object representation of your UI). Once it has this new tree, React will "diff" it against the previous element tree in order to figure out how the UI should change in response to the new state. By doing this, React will then know the exact changes which occurred, and by knowing exactly what changes occurred, it will able to minimize its footprint on the UI by only making updates where absolutely necessary.

This process of creating an object representation of the DOM is the whole idea behind the "Virtual DOM". Now, what if instead of targeting and rendering to the DOM, we need to target and render to another platform -- say iOS or Android. Theoretically, the DOM is just an implementation detail. Besides the name itself (which, in my opinion, was more of a marketing ploy than anything), there's nothing that couples the idea of the Virtual DOM to the actual DOM. This is the exact idea behind React Native. Instead of rendering to the web's DOM, React Native renders to native iOS or Android views. This allows us to build native iOS and Android applications just by using React Native.


### Summary
React Native's "learn once, write anywhere" approach allows us to use the same principles that we know to develop for both web and native platforms. After all, under the hood, many of the same principles of the Virtual DOM, reconciliation, and diffing algorithm apply whether it's a web application built with React or a mobile application built with React Native.
